Using MSI for VSIX,
	You don't show up in Extension Manager by default
		Can work around
	Can't uninstall via Extension Manager
	Enable/disable does not work
	No update notifications

	Only buys you initial acquisition


If we go with the VSIX
	We can, on first run, place stuff where we want
		May require elevation
		Might not be on first launch, but sometime after install

Injecting items directly into project file
	This could be a VSIX
	What happens when you send out an update?
		Users have to go to every project they have ever created and fix it

NuGet
	Offers ability to download all the pieces and install them
	This is a project level action like Add New Item
		Each project would get a copy of the project items
			Some caching occurs at the solution level
		Upgrading projects becomes difficult because you have to refactor the code
